          A happy new year to everyone...first of all.
          <br />
          <br />
          It has been a long break. One and I half month since I coded in a
          focused manner. This blog, is about my comeback.
          <br />
          <br />
          Well, after those stupid university end semester examinations, I was
          interrupted by a vacation that spanned for the whole month of December
          2023. I went home, enjoyed my vacations. Explored all the town with my
          pal, did some mischief with my sister and what not ?.... Going home
          after spending a whole lot of time alone all by yourself feels good.
          Holidays went well, all thanks to that best friend.
          <br />
          <br />
          Then came the time when I had to come to the university campus again.
          Well, that was fine too. The totally unexpected shit that happened
          immediately after coming right here( I am in the campus as of now ..)
          is that my laptop got short circuited. The motherboard is damaged, to
          be more precise.
          <br />
          <br />
          AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.............
          <ImageComponent imgProps={gifProps} />
          Wow ! What a miserable moment to go through, a sudden hole in my
          pocket after bearing expenses of travelling from my home which is 2000
          kilometers away. Anyways, I sent it for repair and had to wait for a
          span of 3 weeks approximately to get it back to my room.
          <br />
          <br />
          Meanwhile, my university professors who remained dormant until my 5th
          semester started off this new semester by announcing us course
          projects. Wow again. 6 course projects in total, one for each course.
          A professor teaching another course called MMDP ( Multi modal data
          processing and learning ) also announced two more mini projects. I
          mean.... why. Why now. Why exactly at the time when my laptop went for
          repair should all this happen ? ( Ah and yes, you're thinking right, I
          am exactly complaining about my campus courses here. )
          <br />

          ></img>
          <br />
          <br />
          Anyways, putting aside all these disheartening announcements about
          course logistics, amidst my miserable situation, I managed to finish a
          good book about deep learning using Keras in 3 days. Productivity
          boosted up exponentially without the presence of my laptop, I guess.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, laptop returned.And guess what, the first thing I did after
          its return is binge watch a movie. ( Don't expect me to code 24 x 7
          bruh. I know I disappointed you. ðŸŒš )
          <br />
          <br />
          And now as usual, I am here, sticking to my laptop screen, coding some
          useless shit and writing this blog. That's all I have to tell you. I
          know, I know, this story seems like my Laptop's comeback more than my
          comeback.
          <br />
          <br />
          Anyways, bye for now. Hope we'll meet soon again. Keep reading my
          blogs. I will post things soon.
